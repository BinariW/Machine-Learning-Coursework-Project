# Machine-Learning-Coursework-Project
This contains a python code file and a Word report conducting and explaining the analysis of three datasets using supervised (regression and classification) techniques and unsupervised learning techniques. Relevant research questions were also discussed and the outcomes were analysed using coding, as well as comparisons to the results of existing literature.
